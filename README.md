# DBSCAN and  Parallel DBSCAN  python implementation 

### Data minign clustering algorithms
* Normal DBSCAN
* Parallel DBSCAn

### Implemenation 
* Language- Python
* IDE-Google Colab 


### Google Colab

Google Colab is a cloud technology that provides free Jupiter notebooks that are executed on a high-end machine. For the project we used the following specifications:- 

* CPU: 1 single core hyper threaded i.e(1 core, 2 threads) Xeon Processors @2.3Ghz , 45MB Cache.
* RAM: ~12.6 GB Available.

### program Execution
 * Load the file into [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index)
 * Store the point datasers in Google drive
 * Fetech the data from Google Drive to Google Colab environment
 
  Example: to load a specific point file into Google Colab use the following method
 *  load_points(points_list_from_file)
